# Telemetry's Future

## Overview

Common telemetry questions:

- Where is telemetry documented? (For implementation or curiosity)
- Can telemetry be extended? And to what?
    - Who decides these things?

This change aims to answer those questions and provide a path forward.

!!! note "Short answer -- it's documented here, we can extend it, and we all get to decide how."

## Telemetry Steering Committee

It is worth putting a bit of a notional structure around the development of Telemetry going forward.

It makes sense to have a committee to discuss (in public on the forum) the pros/cons of any given change to Telemetry.

    - Everyone

### Message Types Prototyping - Easy

There is a <a href="/pro/codec/" target="_blank">Extended Telemetry playground</a> tool available to let you prototype the set of fields that might exist in an Extended Telemetry message.

Have a play around with it, see what makes sense, and share with the group if you think you're on to something.

As usual, copying the URL of the page shares everything you see.

!!! example "See the [Example Message - GPS Stats](../../../pro/telemetry/extended/README.md#example-message-gps-stats) example in Extended Telemetry"
