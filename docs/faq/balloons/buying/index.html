You have two options, and they both get you 10 balloons (minimum order quantity):
1. Medium-fast and most expensive (4 days, $250)
2. Medium-slow and less expensive (18 days, $209)

Medium-fast and expensive - buy direct from Yokohama.
Medium-slow and less expensive - use a forwarding service who can save you money on shipping.

If you want the forwarding service, see below.

Tenso asks you to select a shipper.

You select the shipper with help from the <a href="https://www.tenso.com/en/estimate">shipping calculator</a>.
(For a box of ten balloons I used 1.5 pounds and a box size of 23” x 6.5” x 4.5”)
