## Contact Details

Your best bet is to sign up to the [https://groups.io/g/picoballoon](https://groups.io/g/picoballoon){:target="_blank"} forum where many experienced and enthusiastic people chat and share their experiences flying pico balloons, experimenting, and overcoming challenges.

The [Traquito Jetpack](https://groups.io/g/picoballoon/topic/97685658){:target="_blank"} thread is the ideal place to ask questions relating to this tracker specifically. If you need to contact me directly, please ask for contact details on that thread while explaining what you need help with and why it needs to be private (I have not seen any direct emails that really needed to be private, and I think everyone benefits from open communication!).

For all other questions, create a new topic on the forum and folks will surely help!
