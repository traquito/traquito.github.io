# History

## Recognition

The Traquito technologies build on the contributions made by others that came before.


## Credit

[Hans Summers](http://www.hanssummers.com/){:target="_blank"} designed the [Channel scheme and U4B protocol](https://qrp-labs.com/ultimate3/ve3kcl-balloons/ve3kcl-s4.html#protocol){:target="_blank"} and was later used in his [U4B tracker](https://qrp-labs.com/u4b.html){:target="_blank"}.

!!! note "U4B protocol is labeled Basic Telemetry on this site"
    The designation was given to highlight the the relationship of that data encoding to the Enhanced Telemetry subsequently introduced.


Pedro Converso runs the [LU7AA](http://lu7aa.org/wsprset.asp){:target="_blank"} tracking and registration website.

    Hello everyone, today Pedro LU7ABF left us forever; we will remember him for inspiring us, for the work and research he did for Amsat Argentina and for his beloved Radio Club QRM Belgrano. Today he rests in peace. A sad Sunday for the entire amateur radio community.
